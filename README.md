## Overview

### The challenge

* After creating couple projects you usually want to show them somewhere. 
* So with a little nudge from outside I've created one for myself. 
* At the moment it's not much, only 4 of my projects and 1 stock item.
* But the grid will grow, probably glow a little more as well.
